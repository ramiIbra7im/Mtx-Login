            me to become a complete person with an individual identity. They have given me the sense of care, security,
            and safe environment to flourish in. My family consists of two siblings, and my parents. Also, We are raising
            a cat that has become a part of our family, and we call her vanilla. I gain my strength and inspiration from each
            part of the family. My mother is the main person who I can get my strength from. Our mother is a housewife.
            I can always depend on her, and when I need a shoulder to lean on, I always find her by my side. She is the backbone of our family.
            While my father is our superhero, he works as a doctor who is respected and renowned in his career, and he is a someone who always hide his troubles,
            stresses, and sickness away for the sake of his family. He always gives me strength, and teaches me how to be an independent one. Moreover,
            my siblings are my best friends, whom I can find with the meaning of comfort, support, and encouragement. My family is my power, my source of happiness,
            and comfort. They always push me to achieve newer heights, and become a good human.
